            Convexity is a thing. \newline {$\!\begin{gathered} x^\lambda \leq (1 - \lambda) + \lambda x \qquad \forall \lambda \in (0,1) \\ a^\lambda b^{1-\lambda} \leq \lambda a + (1 - \lambda)b \ \ \forall \lambda \in (0,1), \ \ \forall a,b \geq 0\end{gathered}$} & This is an example. \\[6pt] \hline
            \textbf{H\"{o}lder's Inequality} - For conjugate exponents $p$ and $q$, the $1$-norm of a product of $L^p$ and $L^q$ functions is finite, and the $1$-norm of the product is less than or equal to the product of the norms of the original functions. \newline {$\!\begin{gathered}\norm{fg}_1 \leq \norm{f}_p\norm{g}_q \end{gathered}$}\SP & This is an example. \\[6pt] \hline
            \textbf{Interpolation Inequality} - For $1 \leq r \leq s \leq t \leq \infty$, if $u$ is in $L^r$ and $L^t$, then $u$ is in $L^s$ and the $s$-norm is less than of equal to the product of the $r$- and $t$-norms raised to the appropriate power. \newline {$\!\begin{gathered}\norm{u}_s \leq \norm{u}_r^a \norm{u}_t^{1-a}\qquad \text{where } \frac{1}{s} = \frac{a}{r} + \frac{1-a}{t} \\ L^r \cap L^t \subset L^s \end{gathered}$} \SP & This is an example. \\[6pt] \hline

                    converge uniformly to $f$ on compact subsets of the space (given $f$ is continuous), and
